            <div class="x">            <p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.
                A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.
                <br>
                Homer no function beer well without. Me fail English? That's unpossible. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!
                <br>
                A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.
                I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*
                <br>
                The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity…
                When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!
                Beer. Now there's a temporary solution.
                Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.
                But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.
                <br>
                I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.
                Duffman can't breathe! OH NO!
                Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.
                I was saying "Boo-urns." I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.
                Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.
                Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Save me, Jeebus.
                Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!
                Thank you, steal again. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.
                Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Thank you, steal again. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.
                Please do not offer my god a peanut. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.
                I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Ahoy hoy? And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. D'oh.
                Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.
                Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.
            Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
